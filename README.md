## 🌿 Who Am I?  
I’m a **vibe coder**—a wizard-in-training learning the arcane language of code.  
Each line is a spell, each project a ritual, blending philosophy, anthropology, and foraging wisdom with the rhythm of jazz, techno, and blues.  

Like the “Resume” man from String Cheese Incident, I’ve got [50 years of experience finally equals my age](https://youtu.be/JP-MjPcw74E)—50 and counting—and I’m casting code into a sci-fi reality where AI is my co-pilot.  

- 💻 **Python** & **JavaScript** as spells of my craft  
- 🔮 **AI** as a mystical partner reshaping creativity & reality  
- 🌳 Rooted in **philosophy, psychology, anthropology**, and nature’s signals  
- 🍄 Forager of wild plants, mushrooms, and hidden patterns of the universe  
- ⚡ Corporate IT by day, apprentice of creative code sorcery by night

## 🚀 Current Quests  
Fusing **automation** with **creative magic**:  
- Harmonizing **Python scripts**, **Quickbase automations**, and **JavaScript UIs**  
- Exploring **AI as a magical co-pilot**, where intuition meets algorithms  
- Crafting tools that feel like they belong in a sci-fi epic

## 🌌 API Magic — Portals Between Dimensions  
I see APIs as shimmering portals in the multiverse—gateways that let different realms (apps, databases, ecosystems) speak and share their power.  

Like an **interdimensional counselor**, I negotiate between these worlds, translating their tongues, calming their conflicts, and weaving them into a living code ecosystem.  

- 🌐 Building bridges where silos once stood  
- 🔗 Binding **Python scripts**, **Quickbase apps**, **QuickBooks**, **Tsheets**, **ServiceNow**, and other **cloud APIs** into one spell circle  
- 💫 Making the invisible connections flow like magic energy between dimensions

## 🎶 The Code Grimoire  
Coding is my ritual—jazz improvisation, techno pulse, and blues wail translated into logic and loops. Debugging is philosophy in motion. Shipping is art unleashed.  

> *“Code is my spellbook, AI my familiar, and every commit a charm in a sci-fi saga.”*

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
I debug with the same instinct I use to spot a rare mushroom—patience, pattern recognition, and a spark of sci-fi magic.
