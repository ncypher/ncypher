### 🌱 About Me  
I’m a **vibe coder** — I learn code the same way I approach music, philosophy, or foraging in the woods: by following intuition, curiosity, and flow.  
Though I’m new to coding on paper, it often feels like remembering something I already knew.  

- 💻 Exploring **Python** and **JavaScript** as my core tools  
- 🤖 Fascinated by **AI** and how it reshapes creativity and work  
- 🌳 Background in **philosophy, psychology, and anthropology**  
- 🍄 Forager of ideas (and sometimes mushrooms)  
- ⚡ Corporate IT professional diving into creative coding experiments after hours

### 🔭 Current Vibes  
- Building projects that blend **IT workflows** with **creative code**  
- Learning how **Python scripts**, **Quickbase automations**, and **JavaScript UIs** can harmonize  
- Experimenting with **AI-assisted creativity** — coding with intuition, not just syntax

### 🎶 Vibe Coding  
To me, coding is less about rigid rules and more about rhythm, discovery, and flow:  

> *"Write code like it’s music. Debug like it’s philosophy. Ship like it’s art."*
